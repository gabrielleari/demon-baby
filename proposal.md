## Description
Demon baby goes into different circles of hell in flappy bird style game mock-up. I will make new assets for the project and background will change as demon baby enters new circle(each level passed).


## Features
- Feature 1 
	- on click demon baby gets shot up slightly
- Feature 2
	- program sound fx
- Feature 3
	- changing background to keep track of level

## Challenges
- Will need to learn how to work on collision (player loses when demon baby hits a wall).

- Will need to learn how to implement sound fx in python 

- Will need to learn how to create pillars baby is unable to hit(putting in pngs).

- Putting in score and lvl tracking

- Changing background once new lvl is hit

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- It effectively gives off the vibe of a demon baby traversing in hell. Game has good sound fx, good changing lvl background, good usage of colors

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The game doesnt crash and computer can keep track of score, baby doesn't go through pillars, baby dies when hit by pillar, does not die when avoiding pillars, everything is readable
